## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to build out the huddle landing page and get it looking as close as the provided design as possible. 
This challenge was done without access to the design files and rather by estimating sizes of elements. However, the style guide provided by Frontend Mentor helped by providing colors, font-sizes, font-family, etc.

### What I learned

At first I tried to make the background image an HTML tag, but had a few issues positioning the content on top. So I decided to make the background image apart of the body's background image. The image repeated a little bit, but after researching background-size property on MDN, I was able to fix this problem.

I added a width on the grid container so that everything doesn't touch the sides
