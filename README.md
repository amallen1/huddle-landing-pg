## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to build out the huddle landing page and get it looking as close as the provided design as possible. 
This challenge was done without access to the design files and rather by estimating sizes of elements. However, the style guide provided by Frontend Mentor helped by providing colors, font-sizes, font-family, etc.

### What I learned

At first I tried to make the background image an HTML tag, but had a few issues positioning the content on top. So I decided to make the background image apart of the body's background image. The image repeated a little bit, but after researching background-size property on MDN, I was able to fix this problem.

I added a width on the grid container so that everything doesn't touch the sides

I also ran into a small issue when it came to styling the call to action "register button" because I made it a link and tried to give a height and width but it didn't display. After researching, I remembered that HTML link tags are inline elements, so they only take up as much width as necessary. Setting the link's display property to block solved my problem.

I also learned while creating the box shadow for the call to action button that the offset x affects the shadow to the left and right of the element and the y offset affects the top and bottom.
