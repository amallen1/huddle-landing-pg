## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to build out the huddle landing page and get it looking as close as the provided design as possible. 
This challenge was done without access to the design files and rather by estimating sizes of elements. However, the style guide provided by Frontend Mentor helped by providing colors, font-sizes, font-family, etc.
